STILL TO DO:
- fix Alacritty if you're still going to use it -- it was completely uninstalled because the config file wasn't loading and the only way to get the latest version (still didn't seem to work with the config file) was through Snapd. 
- Look into alternatives, like kitty or WezTerm
- whatever you choose, add it to the Ansible files, including the customizations you want in a terminal/files dir

- have made only tmux and installed nerd font, haven't done anything with vim, vscode, or anything additional
